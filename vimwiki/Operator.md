1. the `%` operator can be very usfull when used to generate a random number, and given a very large number.
    ex: when generating a number from 0 to a very larg number then we can use the `%` operator to decide to which number we want to generate. so if we devide it by 20 the remiander will be a number between 1 and 20. 
    
2. every variable whatever type it is, it is true execpt if it is 0 or false. so if we declear an `int x = 1` and then did `if (x)` then the result will always be true.
