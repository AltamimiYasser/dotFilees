1. `int argc` tell us how many arguments the user passed to the program at initializing.
2. alway the first argument `argv[0]` is the application name and `argv[1]` and so on is the other arguments the user passed.
3. everything stored in `argv` is stored as a string even if the user typed `int` values it will be read `"number"` as a string.
