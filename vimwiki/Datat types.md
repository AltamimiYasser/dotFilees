* *Datat types that comes with c*:

    1. `int`: 
        * they take 4 bytes of memory (32 bit)
        * `int` ranges between about +2 billions to -2 billions
        * there is a type called `unsigned int` and that lets you use it only for positive number
    
    2. `char`:
        * they take one byte (8 bit).
        
    3. `float`:
        * they take 4 bytes of memory (32 bit)
        * they have a prescision problem

    4. `duouble`:
        * they take bytes fo memory (64 bit)
    
    5. `void`:
        * `void` is a type but not a data type, aka we cannot create a variable with the void type but we can return it or represent nothing by this type.
    

* *Data types that comes with CS50:
    
    1. `bool`:
        * true or false

    2. `string`:
    

# how to work with variables:

    1. to ceate a variable all you really need is the type of the variable and its name:
        ```
        int x;
        int y, z, j;
        ```
    2. it is considered good design to declear a variable whenever you need it.
