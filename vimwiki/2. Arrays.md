1. arrays in c has to be of the same data type.
2. the last index of an array is the length of the array - 1. which means that if we have `array[20]`, then the last index is `array[19]`.
3. if you go out of the index of the array - before or after the last index - then `c` will not stop you from that at compile time but you might encounter a `segmentation faul` error at run time.
4. array declaration: `type name[size]`.
5. to declare an array and assign it at the same time: `bool truth_table[3] = {false, true, false};`
6. also we can declare an array without the size if we are assigning it immediatlly because the compiler is smart enouth to figureout for us how many elements we want depending on how many elements we enter: `boot truth_table[] = {true, false, true, true};`
7. arrays can have multible dimension, so if we want to create the battleship game with a 10 x 10 table we can declare it like this: `int battleship[10][10]`.
8. we can treat an index of an array as a variable so we can assign to it and change its value and copy to it.
9. However, we can't treat a whole array as a variable, so we cannot copy an entire array to another.
10. if we want to really copy one array to another we have to use a loop to copy over element by element.
11. arrays are passed by refrence to its location in memory unlike other variables that are passed by value - as that the variable is copied and a new copy exists for the caller to minibulate the copy and not the original variable.
